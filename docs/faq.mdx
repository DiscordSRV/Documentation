### How can I disable a feature/message? {#disable-a-featuremessage}

In most cases by clearing a value in the config. `option: ""`

<!-- TODO create a custom advanced diff highlighting plugin (git diff --word-diff) -->

For example:
```diff
- DiscordChatChannelServerStartupMessage: ":white_check_mark: **Server has started**"
+ DiscordChatChannelServerStartupMessage: ""
```

For format options with embeds, you just set `Enabled` to `false`:

```diff
MinecraftPlayerLeaveMessage:
-  Enabled: true
+  Enabled: false
  Webhook:
    Enable: false
    AvatarUrl: "%botavatarurl%"
    Name: "%botname%"
  Content: ""
  Embed:
    Enabled: true
    Color: "#ff0000"
    Author:
      ImageUrl: "%embedavatarurl%"
      Name: "%username% left the server"
      Url: ""
    . . .
```

### How can I change a notification message embed back to plain text? {#embed-back-to-plain-text}

By moving the value in `Embed.Author.Name` to `Content` and setting `Embed.Enabled` to `false`

```diff
MinecraftPlayerLeaveMessage:
  Enabled: true
  Webhook:
    Enable: false
    AvatarUrl: "%botavatarurl%"
    Name: "%botname%"
-  Content: ""
+  Content: "%username% left the server"
  Embed:
-    Enabled: true
+    Enabled: false
    Color: "#ff0000"
    Author:
      ImageUrl: "%embedavatarurl%"
-      Name: "%username% left the server"
+      Name: ""
      Url: ""
    ...
```

### Is DiscordSRV compatible with BungeeCord? {#compatible-bungeecord}

No, but you can install the plugin on every Bukkit server. (Do **not** use the same token for more than 1 server!)

If you would like to have linked accounts shared across servers, you can connect your DiscordSRV instances to a MySQL database ([`Experiment_Jdbc`](/config#experiment_jdbc) options)

### Why won't messages send from Minecraft to Discord? I have TownyChat installed btw. {#messages-wont-send-townychat}

Towny's main channel's name is usually `general`, instead of DiscordSRV's default, `global`.

### I reloaded the plugin/server and now it won't work. {#reloaded-the-pluginserver}

Only reload the plugin using the plugin's specified reload command. (`/discordsrv reload`)

If that doesn't work, restart your server. Some changes need this for them to take effect.

:::info
Plugins made specifically for reloading/stopping/starting plugins (and the built-in server `/reload` command) can make those plugins stop working properly.
:::

### When I join/quit my server, a message isn't sent in the chat channel for me. What gives? {#when-i-joinquit-my-server-a-message-isnt-sent}

You have one of DiscordSRV's permissions to join/quit silently. To disallow this, give yourself or a group one of the following permissions depending on what you want to deactivate.

```yaml
groups:
  Owner:
    permissions:
    - -discordsrv.silentjoin
    - -discordsrv.silentquit
    - '*' #<-- "positive" permissions like this one should be AFTER the negated permissions
```

### How do I fix the error "Unsupported major.minor version 52.0?" {#unsupported-majorminor-version}

Update the server's Java JRE version to `Java 8` or contact your server provider and request an upgrade.

### The plugin crashes when the server starts with the error "Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: INVOKESPECIAL/STATIC on interfaces require ASM 5" {#the-plugin-crashes-at-serverstart}

One of the libraries that DiscordSRV uses ([Reflections](https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections)) requires ASM **Version 5** to work. You're supposedly running a server with an old ASM version (i.e. 4.x) such as kCauldron / Thermos. Sadly this is a server software dependent problem and we are unable to fix it within DiscordSRV without violating plugin guidelines.

:::warning
We do not recommend the use of the following hybrid servers, they are outdated and likely contain bugs and security issues.
:::

####   Fix for Thermos, Cauldron and early KCauldron {#thermos-cauldron-and-early-kcauldron}

The SpecialSource library included with Thermos uses ASM4. Updating it to the latest version will fix the issue.
Instructions for updating to ASM5:

1. Navigate to the `libraries\net\md-5\SpecialSource\1.7-SNAPSHOT` folder of the server
2. Delete the SpecialSource-1.7-SNAPSHOT.jar file
3. Download SpecialSource v1.7.4 from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/md-5/SpecialSource/1.7.4/SpecialSource-1.7.4.jar
4. Copy the jar file to the `libraries\net\md-5\SpecialSource\1.7-SNAPSHOT` folder
5. Rename the jar file you just copied to SpecialSource-1.7-SNAPSHOT.jar

#### Fix for KCauldron {#kcauldron}

The SpecialSource library included with KCauldron uses ASM4. Updating it to the latest version will fix the issue.
Instructions for updating to ASM5:

1. Navigate to the `bin\net\md-5\SpecialSource\1.7-SNAPSHOT` folder of the server
2. Delete the SpecialSource-1.7-SNAPSHOT.jar file
3. Download SpecialSource v1.7.4 from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/md-5/SpecialSource/1.7.4/SpecialSource-1.7.4.jar
4. Copy the jar file to the `bin\net\md-5\SpecialSource\1.7-SNAPSHOT` folder
5. Rename the jar file you just copied to SpecialSource-1.7-SNAPSHOT.jar

### Only show errors in console-channel
If you want to use your console-channel to only inform you about problems, you can achieve that by modifying the [`DiscordConsoleChannelLevels`](/config#DiscordConsoleChannelLevels) option:
```diff
- DiscordConsoleChannelLevels: [info, warn, error]
+ DiscordConsoleChannelLevels: [error]
```

### Block special console-output from appearing in console-channel {#Block-special-console-output}

DiscordSRV allows you to hide phrases from appearing in console-channel. This can be achieved by making use of [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

Some basic "placeholders" you have to know:

![Regex Reference](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/lectures/lec15-regex/hidden/regex-reference.png)

*RegEx escaping must be done with `\\` instead of `\` in config files*

Here are some examples to visualize how it works:

#### Example 1: Block output of `/save-all`

```yaml
DiscordConsoleChannelFilters: {"^Saving\\.\\.\\.$|^Saved the game$": ""}
```

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='before' label='Before'>
    ```css
    >> save-all
    [Mon, 20. Apr 2020 04:20:69 CDT INFO] Saving the game (this may take a moment!)
    [Mon, 20. Apr 2020 04:20:69 CDT INFO] Saved the game
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='after' label='After'>
    ```css
    >> save-all
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Example 2: Hide lines which contain the string `The updater found an update:`

```yaml
DiscordConsoleChannelFilters: {"^.*The updater found an update:.*$": ""}
```

#### Example 3: Replace the ip address of those that join the game:

```yaml
DiscordConsoleChannelFilters: {"\\[\\/[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+(?::[0-9]+)?\\]": ""}
```

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value='before' label='Before'>
    ```css
    [Mon, 20. Apr 2020 04:20:69 CDT INFO] Scarsz[/192.168.1.2:58076] logged in with entity id 564875 at ([world]0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='after' label='After'>
    ```css
    [Mon, 20. Apr 2020 04:20:69 CDT INFO] Scarsz logged in with entity id 564875 at ([world]0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Can we op players from the discord console? {#op-players-discord-console}  

DiscordSRV by default blacklists the use of a handful of commands through the console channel through the [`DiscordConsoleChannelBlacklistedCommands`](/config#DiscordConsoleChannelBlacklistedCommands) option.

Remove the `"op"` value to allow the command to be used.

```diff
- DiscordConsoleChannelBlacklistedCommands: ["?", "op", "deop", "execute"]
+ DiscordConsoleChannelBlacklistedCommands: ["?", "deop", "execute"]
```

### Why can't I control my music bot from Minecraft? {#music-bot-from-minecraft}

It's bad practice for a bot to listen to another bot's messages. That's why most if not all public music bots can't be controlled through another bot.

### Where is the bot hosted? {#bot-hosted}

On the server that DiscordSRV is used on. The bot is online when the server is online.

### Can I modify the bot using javascript? {#modify-bot-javascript}

No. It's programmed in Java, not Javascript.

### How can I show the player count in the game status? {#player-count-game-status}

This can be done by using [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)'s  
`%playerlist_<type>,<subtype>,<include>,<output>,<subtype_value>%` placeholder  
in our [DiscordGameStatus](https://config.discordsrv.com/config/DiscordGameStatus) option.

1. Make sure you have [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) installed
2. Once the PlaceholderAPI plugin is loaded, run `/papi ecloud download PlayerList` to install the [PlayerList](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders#playerlist) expansion
3. Run `/papi reload` to reload the PlaceholderAPI expansions
4. Read through the [PlayerList documentation](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders#playerlist) on how to use the placeholder
5. You can test the output of the placeholder using the `/papi parse me <placeholder>` command


### Why is the plugin red in the `/plugins` output? {#plugins-output-red}

| if the plugin is: | it means that:            |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| green             | the plugin is working     |
| red               | the plugin is not working |

First thing you should do is check your *server logs*. If you need further help understanding the errors then join [our discord server](https://discordsrv.com/discord) and create a ticket through the #create-a-ticket channel. Send a copy of what you find or the whole log file.

### Where can I find the server log? {#find-log}

Minecraft servers store their logs in `<server_directory>/logs/`. Search for a file explorer in your server's management interface and navigate to that directory. If you find a `logs` folder search for the `latest.log` file. Some providers have a separate page for logs and may hide the `logs` folder.

On Aternos:

- Go to https://aternos.org/log/

On Minehut and server.pro:

- Go to the "`files`" tab in the left menu
- Navigate to the root directory of your server
- From there navigate to `/logs/latest.log`

### What should I do with the server log? {#do-with-log}

- First of all, read it! I mean, that's what you do all the time when you run a server, isn't it? Try to locate any errors that have anything to do with DiscordSRV. If you're having trouble scrolling through the file you can use `Ctrl+F` to search the file for the phrase "DiscordSRV". This will highlight all occurrences of "DiscordSRV" which will make locating the error less difficult.
- If you got the `latest.log` file or created a `.txt` file with the necessary errors then join [our discord server](https://discordsrv.com/discord) and create a ticket through the #create-a-ticket channel and send it there.
- If you have trouble downloading the log file, copy/paste the text to a paste service (like [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/)). Copy the link that it gives you. Join [our discord server](https://discordsrv.com/discord) and create a ticket through the #create-a-ticket channel, then send that link in your ticket.

### Why do I get all the groups instead of just the one I want? {#all-groups-instead-of-one}

Check to make sure you don't have the `*` permission in any of the groups that you're a part of. DiscordSRV has a `discordsrv.sync.<group> permission`, and having the star perm ends up giving you the perm for every group you have synchronized. This is just one of many reasons why you shouldn't ever have the `*` perm, or `OP` for that matter.

### The bot can't modify my roles, and I'm the Discord server owner? {#discord-server-owner-modify-roles}

This is a Discord limitation. Although bots can remove / add one role, they cannot use the endpoint that allows adding & removing as many roles as you want, which is how group-synchronisation achieves this. If you are trying to test group-synchronisation, either use an alt, or test it on another player.

### What chat formatting codes can I use? {#chat-formatting-codes}

To format minecraft chat related options you can use:

* Legacy (Minecraft) `&r` and adventure `&#abc123`

OR

* [MiniMessage](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage.html#format)

You **cannot** use both at the same time!

### Can I synchronize multiple discord roles to one Minecraft group? {#multiple-discord-roles-one-mc-group}

To synchronize multiple discord roles with one Minecraft group you will need to create a "fake" group in the [GroupRoleSynchronizationGroupsAndRolesToSync](https://config.discordsrv.com/synchronization/GroupRoleSynchronizationGroupsAndRolesToSync) option in synchronization.yml and make use of the `discordsrv.sync.<group name>` permission.

Example: if you want to synchronize both the `Discord Staff` and `Discord Admin` discord role when someone has the `MinecraftAdmin` group in-game, you would do the following.

```yaml
GroupRoleSynchronizationGroupsAndRolesToSync: {"MinecraftAdmin": "384977475567878145", "MinecraftStaff": "135634730535092224"}
```

The `MinecraftStaff` group in the example above is temporary. It is just used to store the role ID of our `Discord Staff` role. You would then give the `MinecraftAdmin` group the permission `discordsrv.sync.MinecraftStaff` so that the `MinecraftAdmin` group gets both the `Discord Admin` and `Discord Staff` Discord role.

### How do I connect two discord channels to one Minecraft chat? {#two-discord-channels-one-mc-chat}

Sadly this feature is not yet possible. It will be a feature in V2 of DiscordSRV.

### What is the server room is on fire message? {#server-room-on-fire}
`%date% @Owner, the server room is on 🔥‼`

This means that your server has been lagging for several seconds.

The watchdog constantly monitors the last time your server performed a game tick. If the time since the last tick goes above the set interval in seconds, a message to Discord is triggered.

To disable these messages configure the following in config.yml: [`ServerWatchDogEnabled`](https://config.discordsrv.com/config/ServerWatchdogEnabled)

### Why can't I message the bot? {#why-cant-i-message-the-bot}

Make sure that you have direct messages enabled on the server that you share with the bot. This should allow you to send it a private message. If that doesn't work, [check this article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360060145013).

### How do I show the avatars of cracked players? {#show-cracked-avatars}

If you run an offline mode server you can switch from using `{uuid-nodashes}` to `{username}` in the `AvatarURL` option. Since [crafatar.com](https://crafatar.com/) does not support usage of player names you have to switch to a less stable alternative like [cravatar.eu](https://cravatar.eu/) (less stable meaning it will return a Steve head if the service is heavily used).
