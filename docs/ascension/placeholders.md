# Placeholders
DiscordSRV contains many placeholders which allows you to customise messages entirely to your liking.

Information about which placeholders can be used where can be found in the config.

## Checking for empty placeholders
You can take empty placeholders into account and use an alternate placeholder instead.

For example `%player_meta_prefix|player_prefix%`. This first looks for `%player_meta_prefix%` if that is empty, than `%player_prefix%` is used instead.

## Placeholder Suffixes
Placeholders which provide a list of items can have a suffix set between each item to separate them.

For example `%user_roles:', '%`, lists the users roles seperated by a comma and a space (`', '`).

## Recursive Placeholders
Recursive placeholders are a special type of placeholder which allow you to specify what information you want from it.

In this example we will be using `%user_highest_role_<role>%`. The `%user_highest_role_` part returns the highest role of the user and turns it into a [role placeholder](#role).

You can then use any [role](#role) related placeholders. For example `%user_highest_role_name%` will return the highest roles name, or `%user_highest_role_color%` returns the color of the highest role.

This same premise is used for all the re lookup placeholders.

# Global placeholders
#### `%text:'<text>'"` - Returns arbitrary text. An example of a use case would be changing the placeholder to custom text if it is empty. For example `%player_prefix|text:'No Prefix'%`

# Date formatting
Some placeholders such as `log_time` for console lines take a time formatting string, for example: `ccc HH:mm:ss zzz` in `%log_time:'ccc HH:mm:ss zzz'%`

### (Useful) Formatting characters
Use multiple of the same character back-to-back for a longer output, for example `uu` -> `04`, `uuuu` -> `2004`
