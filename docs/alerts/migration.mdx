title: Alerts migration for fully qualified class names
---

## Background

Previously DiscordSRV used to listen to every single Bukkit event (by hackily registering to every HandlerList).
This causes various issues, mainly with performance but also some unexpected side effects with some special events.
Paper also blocked changing the handler list collection in 1.21.5, preventing this approach from working entirely.

## The fix

To fix DiscordSRV now requires that all event names be defined using their fully-qualified names (that is, including their package name).
For example instead of `PlayerTeleportEvent` you need to use `org.bukkit.event.player.PlayerTeleportEvent`.

## How to

Look for the fully-qualified class names from [Paper's javadocs](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/) or from the documentation of plugin's that your alerts are from.
Below is an image for how to identify the fully-qualified class name for an event on javadocs. Javadocs usually have search at the top right
